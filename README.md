# wikipedia-top-100-companies
In this Python Project, I used BeautifulSoup along with the Request library to extract the table of the top 100 companies from the Wikipedia Website. This involved inspecting the HTML elements of the page to see exactly where the data I was looking for was stored. This was easy enough as the information was stored in a table. After finding the corresponding element names for the table, the table headings and the multiple rows of information, I was able to pull all the information into a DataFrame. There were some columns which were unnecessary and were removed. After which, the desired information was successfully saved into a CSV file.
